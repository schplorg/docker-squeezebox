		<div>In order to use your Squeezebox with Spotify, you'll need to authorize 
		Logitech Media Server using one of Spotify's applications. This can be their desktop 
		client, or one of their mobile apps. Please note that authentication is not possible
		through Spotify's web client. A Spotify Premium subscription is required!</div>
		<div>Just follow these simple steps:</div>

		<div class="spotty-instructions">
			<ol class="spotty">
				<li>Start your Spotify client</li>
				<li>Play some tune in Spotify</li>
				<li>Open Spotify's list of available devices<br><img src="[% webroot %]plugins/Spotty/html/images/desktop-auth.png"></li>
				<li>Pick the "[% "PLUGIN_SPOTTY_AUTH_NAME" | string %]" item (music playback might go silence at this point)</li>
				<li>Wait a few seconds while the application is authorizing Logitech Media Server to use Spotify</li>
				<li>Don't panic - sometimes it can take a dozen or two seconds &#x1F603;</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<div>That's it! This screen should disappear.</div>
		<div><br/>Sometimes the smart authorization fails. In this case authenticate using your username and password in below form.</div>
